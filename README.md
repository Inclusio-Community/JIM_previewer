# JIM Metadata Viewer

An interactive tool for analyzing and validating JSON for Interactive Media (JIM) metadata embedded in SVG files. Also functions as a comprehensive SVG accessibility inspector.

## Features

- **JIM Validation**: Validates JIM metadata against specification requirements
- **Interactive Visualization**: Click SVG elements to inspect their JIM mappings and data
- **Accessibility Audit**: Analyzes SVG accessibility attributes and provides recommendations
- **SVG-Only Mode**: Works with regular SVG files even without JIM metadata
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA implementation

## Quick Start

1. Open `jim-viewer.html` in your browser
2. Upload an SVG file (with or without JIM metadata)
3. Click elements in the visualization to inspect their properties
4. Review validation results and accessibility recommendations

## Files

- `jim-viewer.html`: Interactive HTML viewer for SVGs with JIM metadata
- `triangle-complete-with-jim-metadata.svg`: Example SVG file containing JIM metadata

## Use Cases

- Validate JIM metadata during development
- Debug JIM selector mappings
- Audit SVG accessibility compliance
- Inspect element properties and computed styles

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to preview, validate, and inspect SVG files that include JIM metadata, useful for development and testing of JIM-enabled graphics and accessibility.
